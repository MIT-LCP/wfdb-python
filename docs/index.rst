wfdb
====

Introduction
------------

The native Python waveform-database (WFDB) package. A library of tools
for reading, writing, and processing WFDB signals and annotations.

Core components of this package are based on the original WFDB
specifications. This package does not contain the exact same
functionality as the original WFDB package. It aims to implement as many
of its core features as possible, with user-friendly APIs. Additional
useful physiological signal-processing tools are added over time.


Development
-----------

The development repository is hosted at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/wfdb-python

The package is to be expanded with physiological signal-processing tools, and general improvements. Development is made for Python 3.6+ only.
